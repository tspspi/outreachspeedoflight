# Outreach project utility: Speed of light

_Work in progress_

This is the frontend to the _speed of light_ outreach project. This project
has been developed to measure the speed of light similar to the idea
that Hippolyte Fizeau developed in 1848. In contrast to his experiment
in this case a little cheat is used - a bicycle works as chopper to produce
a sharp difference in light intensity of a laser source. The light travels
through two arms of the experiment - one being only a few meters away from
the chopper, the other being about hundred meters away. The signal of both
pulses is recorded on photodiodes and sampled by a fast oscilloscope (this
is where the cheating comes in - we have a definition of time and fast direct
sampling).

Since this project has been developed to increase the interest in science
and let people participate actively during exhibitions it's by no way a
precision measurement - it's more of a (working) experiment that people
can look at, play with and grasp the idea of light traveling at finite speeds.

This application:

* Gathers data from the oscilloscope
* Visualizes the samples
* Calculates a cross correlation of the symmetrized periodicalized recorded
  function
* Estimates the speed of light from this correlation function by doing
  a simple peak search
* Does averaging over the estimated speed of light and visualized this.

## Experimental setup

The experimental setup consists of two basic parts:

* A chopper assembly - where a bicycle is used (or any other kind of chopper)
* A beam splitter and photodiode assembly as well as a long beam line

# Configuration files

## daq.conf

The data acquisition module configures the communication with the MSO5000 oscilloscope.

Example configuration:

```
{
	"osci" : {
		"ip" : "10.0.0.196",
		"port" : 5555,
		"sperdiv" : 1e-6,
		"trigch" : 1,
		"triglvl" : 0.5,
		"ch1" : {
			"offset" : 0,
			"scale" : 0.5
		},
		"ch2" : {
			"offset" : 0,
			"scale" : 0.1
		},
		"maxqueryrate" : 2
	},
	"chopper" : {
		"diameter" : 68e-2
	},
	"path" : {
		"length" : 100,
		"n" : 1.4
	},
	"loglevel" : "debug",
	"mode" : "continuous"
}
```

The ```osci``` section configured the MSO5000 oscilloscope:

* Connectivity:
   * The ```ip``` field can be either the IP or hostname as string
   * ```port``` is optional and defaults to ```5555```
* Optional _Horizontal axis_ (time) configuration:
   * ```sperdiv``` specifies the seconds per division on the horizontal axis.
     This has to be a value supported by the oscilloscope
* Optional _Trigger_ configuration:
   * ```trigch``` selects a channel (1 or 2) for the trigger to act on
   * ```triglvl``` selects the trigger level in volts.
* Optional channel configuration ```ch1``` and ```ch2```:
   * One can specify an ```offset``` in volts
   * and a ```scale``` specified in _volts per division_ that has to be
     a supported value by the oscilloscope
* A optional maximum query rate in Hz (i.e. queries per second) that can
  be used to limit the amount of queries to the oscilloscope since at some
  point it won't update it's own local display anymore due to prioritization
  of network queries. When not specified the application queries as fast
  as possible.

The ```chopper``` section configures the chopper that is used. For our
experimental setup this can be a bicycle or a simple wooden wheel:

* ```diameter``` configures the diameter of the wheel in meters. This is only
  used for velocity calculation from trigger rate assuming that only one trigger
  is issued per cycle.

An important configuration is the ```path```. This describes the free path
the light pulse is traveling through. One can describe the ```length``` in
meters and the refractive index ```n``` (1 for air or vacuum or about 1.4 for
glass fibers)

At last one can select between two modes of operation using the ```mode```
parameter:

* ```triggered``` uses the scope in single trigger mode and re-arms when ready to
  gather more data. This ensures that both channels correspond to the same
  event but looks less real time on the oscilloscopes local display.
* ```continuous``` continuously samples on the scope and queries data as fast
  as possible.

## gui.conf

The user interface can be configured using ```gui.conf```. This allows one to configure
some analysis parameters:

* The number of last measurements to be shown using ```lastsamples```
* The number of measurements to include in rolling average ```averagecount```
* A optional fit of a Gaussian function into the difference signal (that can
  also be used instead of the autocorrelation function to detect the time delay).
  This is done in the ```difffit``` dictionary:
   * ```enable``` is set to the strings ```"true"``` or ```"false"```. When set
     to true fitting is enabled. Keep in mind this is numerically more demanding
	 than the other methods
   * ```primary``` can be either ```"true"``` or ```"false"```. If set to true
     the FWHM of the fit is used as measure for time delay of the signals and thus
	 to calculate the speed of light. When set to ```"false"``` the fit is only plotted
	 and the speed is still calculated using the cross correlation of both signals
   * ```dump``` is set to ```"true"``` to dump fitting result and parameters
     to the standard output (for debugging purposes)
* To handle noisy signals on the photodiodes ```movingaverage``` can be set to any integer
  value larger than 0 (or to 0 to disable the feature). It applies a moving average
  filter of the specified number of samples - and thus applies a low pass filter
  to the signal.

In addition one can directly configure some layout parameters:

* ```plotsize``` with ```x``` and ```y``` parameters directly scales all plots
* ```mainwindowsize``` with ```x``` and ```y``` parameters scales the main window
  as initially created.

Note that invalid setting of those parameters might clip some graphs or cause
some strange behavior of the user interface.
